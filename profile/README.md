# Welcome to Embrace!

Embrace is observability for a mobile world. Our instrumentation and insights allow you to move beyond mere monitoring, and solve the problems that affect your app.

## Embrace's Commitment to Open

Embrace has fully open-sourced its mobile software development kits. The available SDKs are for Android, iOS, Flutter, ReactNative, and Unity. Pull down the code, try out the instrumentation, and contribute if there's a capability you'd like to see.

Additionally, as Embrace is a mobile-focused member of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io) and an [OpenTelemetry Vendor](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/), each mobile SDK is building towards full compliance with and extension of [OpenTelemetry's key signals](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/). Presently, the iOS and Android SDKs have fully-exportable traces and logs built into their feature sets.

Embrace's mobile SDKs are each published under the AGPLv3 license.
